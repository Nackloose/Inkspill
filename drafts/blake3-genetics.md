## Hash-Based Evolution System Using BLAKE3 2048-bit Hashes

This concept frames *any* chunk of data (text, binary, image, etc.) as a living "organism" whose **genome** is the BLAKE3 hash of that data.  Because BLAKE3 supports extensible output lengths, we fix the digest to **2048 bits (256 bytes)**, giving us a large, evenly distributed genetic search space.

### 1. Genome Construction
1. **Input** – The user supplies an arbitrary byte sequence.
2. **Hashing** – We compute `blake3(input, out_len = 256 bytes)`.
3. **Canonical Genome** – The 2048-bit digest (represented as 512 hex chars) is the organism's immutable *origin genome*.

### 2. Interpreting the Genome
We treat the bit-stream as an ordered list of genes.  How you slice it depends on your domain, but a common pattern is:
- **Gene size:** 8 bits (1 byte) → 256 possible alleles.
- **Chromosomes:** 256 bytes / 8 bytes per chromosome = 32 chromosomes.
- **Traits:** Map each byte (or group of bytes) to phenotypic traits (color, speed, aggression, etc.).
  Example: `gene[0]` controls size, `gene[1]` hue, `gene[2]` metabolic rate … and so on.

Because the hash is uniformly random with respect to its input, every trait is independent and unbiased, ensuring a fair genetic baseline.

### 3. Self-Evolution Mechanisms
1. **Generational Re-Hashing** – To produce a *child*, simply hash the current genome again:
   ```txt
   child_genome = blake3(parent_genome, out_len = 256)
   ```
   This behaves like deterministic asexual reproduction: the lineage is a Markov chain seeded by the original input.
2. **Bit Nudging (Mutation)** – Flip or rotate a small, random subset of bits/hex-nibbles before rehashing.
   ```txt
   mutant = parent_genome ^ random_bitmask
   child_genome = blake3(mutant, out_len = 256)
   ```
   The mask magnitude controls mutation rate.
3. **Sexual Recombination (Optional)** – XOR or interleave halves of two genomes, then hash the result to collapse it back to 2048 bits, ensuring uniform output length.

### 4. Fitness & Selection
The evolution engine itself is *phenotype-agnostic*—it only supplies genomes.  Your implementation defines a **fitness function** that scores an organism's expressed traits.  Typical loop:
1. Generate population.
2. Evaluate fitness for each.
3. Select top-performers.
4. Reproduce via mechanisms above.
5. Repeat until convergence or resource budget exhausted.

### 5. Determinism & Replayability
Because hashing is deterministic, any lineage can be replayed exactly by recording:
- The initial input (seed).
- The sequence of mutation masks (if any).
- The recombination partners.

### 6. Implementation Hints
- Use the official `blake3` library (`pip install blake3` in Python, `cargo add blake3` in Rust).
- Keep genomes as `bytes` internally; convert to hex only for storage/debugging.
- For high throughput, pre-allocate buffers and operate on `bytearray`.
- Because the hash output is uniformly distributed, there is *no* risk of hot-spots—mutation and selection pressure drive diversity.

### 7. Example (Python-like Pseudocode)
```python
from blake3 import blake3

OUT_LEN = 256  # bytes (2048 bits)

def genome(data: bytes) -> bytes:
    return blake3(data, digest_size=OUT_LEN).digest()

def mutate(genome: bytes, rate: float = 0.01) -> bytes:
    import os
    mask = bytearray(os.urandom(len(genome)))
    for i, b in enumerate(mask):
        if random.random() > rate:
            mask[i] = 0  # keep bit unchanged most of the time
    return bytes(g ^ m for g, m in zip(genome, mask))

def next_generation(parent: bytes) -> bytes:
    return genome(parent)  # simple re-hash

seed = b"Hello, world!"
parent = genome(seed)
child = next_generation(parent)
```
