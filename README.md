# Inkspill

> A loose collection of drafts, notes, fragments, and half-formed thoughts — the messy beginnings before ideas become Axia.

## What is Inkspill?

**Inkspill** is the scratchpad, the journal, the floor scattered with pages. It’s where ideas arrive in raw form — unpolished, unfiltered, and in-progress.

This is not a place for polish or permanence. It’s where:
- Fragments are dropped before they’re connected
- Drafts are written without fear of being right
- Thoughts are captured before they’re lost
- Notes, experiments, and sketches live freely

Some of these spills will evolve into structured truths. Some won’t. That’s the point.

## Contents

Expect a mix of:

- `notes/` — raw thoughts, outlines, observations  
- `drafts/` — in-progress writings, early versions of documents  
- `ideas/` — conceptual stubs, questions, prompts  
- `experiments/` — partial designs, code tests, structural sketches  
- `quotes/` — captured words, references, and sparks of inspiration

Naming and structure may be inconsistent — and that’s fine.

## Contributing

This repo is intentionally chaotic. If contributing, embrace the mess. Leave room for contradictions and unfinished thoughts.

Think of it as a **shared notebook**, not a published paper.

## Relationship to Axia

If **Axia** is the canon — the distilled and enduring truths —  
**Inkspill** is the creative chaos that comes before.

Ideas are spilled here, sifted, then (sometimes) shaped into something worthy of lasting value.
